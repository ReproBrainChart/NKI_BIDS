## NKI RBC README
This is the neuroimaging dataset for the Nathan Klein Institue Rockland Sample. The [NKI Rockland Sample Initiative](https://www.nki.rfmh.org/content/rockland-sample) 
is a landmark research program aiming to map the brain, understand how it develops and changes over the course of life, 
and explore the connections between our brain and behavior.  Studies like this have the potential to change how we 
treat diseases from depression to Alzheimerâ€™s.The NKI Rockland Sample is funded by the 
US National Institutes of Health and the NY State Office of Mental Health. 

This version of the dataset was curated at the University of Pennsylvania by the Lifespan Informatics 
and Neuroimaging Center (PennLINC) as part of the "Reproducible Brain Chart" (RBC) Initiative. RBC seeks to aggregate, 
organize QA, process, curate, and openly disseminate many of the largest cross-sectional studies of brain development.
